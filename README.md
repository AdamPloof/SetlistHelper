# SetlistHelper

SetlistHelper stores a collection of songs in a musicians repetoire and outputs ideas for a set list for a gig. It constructs the set list from various parameters and properties of the stored songs to artistically craft a set list that is appropriate to the gig.

For instance, you can ask SetlistHelper to craft a set list that fills roughly 45 minutes of music, starts mellow and gradually builds in dynamics and intesity towards the end of the set with a slight dip at the 2/3 point of the set.
